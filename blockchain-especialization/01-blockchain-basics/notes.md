# Week 1

##  Bitcoin & blockchain

Learning objectives:
- Explain three fundamentals characteristics that define a blockchain
- Explain the important features of Ethereum blockchain
- Explain algorithms and techniques that enable a blockchain
- Outline methods for realizing trust in a blockchain

(extracted from Blockchain Structure video)
Here is the basic structure of a blockchain. Transaction is the basic element of the Bitcoin Blockchain. Transactions are validated and broadcast. Many transactions form a block. Many box form a chain through a digital data link. Blocks go through a consensus process, to select the next block that will be added to the chain. Chosen block is verified, and added to the current chain. Validation and consensus process are carried out by special peer nodes called miners. These are powerful computers executing software defined by the blockchain protocol. Let's now discuss the details of a single transaction in bitcoin. A fundamental concept of a bitcoin network is an Unspent Transaction Output, also known as UTXO. The set of all UTXOs in a bitcoin network collectively defined the state of the Bitcoin Blockchain. UTXO's are referenced as inputs in a transaction. UTXO's those are also outputs generated by a transaction. All of that UTXO's is in a system, are stored by the participant nodes in a database. Now let's review the role of the UTXO's in a Bitcoin Blockchain. The transaction uses the amount specified by one or more UTXOs and transmits it to one or more newly created output UTXOs, according to the request initiated by the sender.
